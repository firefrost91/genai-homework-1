      "A bell struck some indifferent hour. The sound hit the high walls and scattered into dust. I flexed my fingers. They were good for gripping and for stealing; both uses left the same dull ache. My coin sat in the hollow of my palm, heavy with promise. I turned it over. It felt colder than the rest of the city.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Then a whisper of metal sang near my ear. Not the clink of coin. A voice without voice. It tugged at the hollow under my sternum, a promise of leverage—of a handhold where there was none. Instinct wanted to clutch it. Training told me not to. Curiosity told me everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "I let the tug guide my steps. It was a small, dangerous thing: a choice that opened a hundred doors. I slid between two shadowed figures, pressed my back to cold brick, and watched as the night moved on around the secret it had revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coin in my pocket warmed. I smiled without meaning to. The ash kept falling, endless and patient, and for the first time in a long while, the city felt like a place I could answer back.\n"

Here’s an original, never-before-seen novella-length vignette set among Era One characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sazed smelled it before he saw it—ash and something bitterer, the perfume of old smoke clinging to paper. The house sat half-swallowed by the mist, its once-grand façade pitted and dark. A noble's private library, the Keeper thought; his fingers itched to reach out and touch the histories that might still hide beneath blackened drapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vin moved like a shadow that the mists approved. She dropped onto the sill, boots whispering against soaked stone, eyes hard and bright under the hood. Around her, the crew waited: Breeze with his half-smile and fingers already loosening the knots of nerves in the guards below, Ham flexing like spring steel, Spook perched in a corner with his eyes too big in his dark face—a watchful rodent perhaps, but loyal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How bad?\" Sazed asked, voice careful as always. He had come to protect knowledge as much as people. What other Keeper was there to fetch the world's stories when the world wanted to burn them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Breeze answered, voice like warm wine. \"A noble's purge. They want loose tongues silenced and their names removed. The fires are small—clever hands at work—but the intent of a noble makes little fires dangerous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vin's gloved hand found the tins of metal at her belt, significance bright and cool. \"Then let's be cleverer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They slipped inside with the mists as company—soft fingers that coated bookshelves and frames and made the candles gutter. Sazed's lantern showed them rows of volumes, some edges charred, some still whole beneath the ash like last leaves in a winter chest. He walked through memories, tracing spines that remembered better times, trying to make them speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were men in the back, two with torches and a third with a sack of things to throw into the growing pyre. Ham moved first—no show, just the blunt certainty of a fist. He took one down with a single, expertly placed blow. The other spun and found Vin already at the rope, steel pushed, coinshot used to yank the torchholder's arm away. The torch clattered; Sparks of orange skittered across vellum, but Vin was faster. She flipped, shoulder, hands, and sent a stack of ledgers tumbling in a neat, dangerous arc. Spook, small and sudden, darted to catch them, eyes shining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breeze worked like a calm wind through panic, calming the remaining man until he couldn't remember his purpose. The emotional scent of fear dulled under the pressing comfort of a friendly word; the man knelt and wept—not for the books, but for reasons he couldn't name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sazed gathered what he could. He wrapped manuscripts in oilcloth with trembling, reverent hands, feeling the weight of prayers, of accounts, of lines of songs that had kept a house honest. Beneath a scorched leather binding he found a small booklet—devotional verses from a skaa grandmother, prayers that fit in a pocket and a heart. The edges were singed but whole. He pressed it close and felt, absurdly, the warmth of a hearth that had never been his.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, ash fell steadily. The city stayed the same: a place where men built great things and others tried to erase them. Inside the house, however, a few more stories lived. Vin looked at Sazed with the honesty of someone who had seen what losing could do. \"You always collect the things, don't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sazed smiled—the Keeper's smile, patient and grave. \"If no one keeps them, do they ever truly exist?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They left with the books. The noble who had hired the fire watched from a balcony, eyes narrowed at the retreating shapes. The mists closed again, swallowing sound. Ham hummed an old rhythm as they carried their bundles over the roofs. Breeze sang under his breath to keep the tension away. Spook chattered now and then, proud at being part of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sazed opened the small booklet under a light of stars peeking through the ash clouds. One page held a single, simple line: a blessing for hands that work. He copied it into his chain-bound field notes with hands that trembled not from cold but from the realization that the smallest prayers could be as stubborn as the steel in a Mistborn's grip.\n",
      "\n",
      "They returned it to the Hostel of the Keepers that night. Sazed placed the booklet where it belonged—labelled, catalogued, and safe. In the quiet after, with ash settling over the city like an old promise, he thought of how few people would ever know the name of the grandmother whose prayer he had rescued.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recorded it anyway. For where there is a keeper, there is hope. For where there are stories, there are people who remember to be brave.\n"

      "\n",
      "Vin had learned, slowly, that Luthadel’s mists told truths the daylight could not. They slid along gutters, pooled in alleys; they kept secrets for those who listened. She stood on a slate roof with tenshades of dawn squeezing over the city, TenSoon a hulking silhouette behind her, scenting the air with the careful patience of a kandra.\n",

      "Vin tasted it in her mouth first—something metallic beneath the ash, like the tang of steel warmed in a forge. Not Allomantic metal, not yet, but a trace of intent. She felt the mists like fingers on her skin and pulled inward, testing her coin. Feruchemy would have measured calm; Allomancy measured weight. She drew a breath of bottled steely resolve and stepped off the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mist swallowed her, and the city rearranged itself. Rooflines blurred, chimneys became pillars of the world. She swung toward the sound: a scuffle below, a cry choked off like a candle in wind. TenSoon rolled silently behind her, every limb controlled with the odd grace of a creature built for mimicry.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found a boy pinned against a doorway, his cap askew, a merchant standing over him with a string of teeth like a broken comb. The merchant’s jacket bore a sigil—one Vin only half-recognized: an open hand, fingers splayed, painted in rushed black. Someone had been quick to claim an emblem after the Lord Ruler fell; the city sprouted banners like mildew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Move.” Vin’s word was thin, but she pushed with a little of her metal—steel to fling, pewter to steady—and the merchant stumbled, more surprised than hurt. Breeze’s laugh drifted down the lane a heartbeat later, the mist carrying not only sound but the soft perfumes the man liked to wear. He stepped from behind a stack of crates, hands in his pockets, eyes amused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re making me miss a good negotiation,” he said, all silky charm. Behind him, Ham rose from where he’d been leaning on a lamppost, the muscle in his jaw as steady as a plow. Dockson watched from the shadow of a doorway, ledger in hand—always a ledger—and Spook flitted somewhere above, a shadow among shadows, face lit with the sort of curious greed that came from newly granted freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The merchant was bluster, the sort of petty lordling who wanted to test the new order. Vin felt it—fear wrapped in bravado. She pushed again, a sharper tug of steel; the man’s blade clattered uselessly into the cobbles. TenSoon’s hand was on his shoulder in an instant, the creature’s grip like iron wrapped in velvet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will not take what is not yours,” Vin said. The words felt heavy, like a sentence being carved. Elend’s reforms breathed in the air: law where there had been cruelty, a hope that felt dangerously like a thing that could be smashed. She thought of the Council upstairs, of Sazed’s patient cataloging of rituals and prophecies, of Elend standing at a dais and choosing mercy like a weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The merchant sneered but retreated, counting his losses with the eyes of someone who had always bought safety. Breeze’s smile flashed, and the small crowd—skaa with dirt in their hair, a noble's servant with his nose already gone out of fashion—began to disperse.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ash settled again around their boots, Vin crouched beside the boy. His hands shook. “I thought the riots had started,” he whispered. “Thought someone came to mark the first of us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Vin looked up, and the mist seemed suddenly colder. TenSoon bent and pressed the heel of his palm to a splintered piece of slate near the doorway. There, half-hidden under ash, was a carved mark. Not the merchant’s hand. A different symbol: a single, straight line, like a spearhead. Old, she thought. Older than the sprouting banners. Dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sazed would call it a sigil of concern; Elend would draft a council meeting. For Vin it was a sharper thing: the knowledge that the city, newly free, had wounds that were not yet healed. Freedom left space for new hands—hands that might be gentler, or hands that would squeeze until bone whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "She rose, feeling the metal in her like a heartbeat. “We tell the Council,” she said. “And we watch the roofs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "TenSoon’s eyes watched her for a long moment, kandra patience like stone. “Kandra will watch, too,” he said quietly. “For you.”\n",

Luthadel smelled the same as always—sour coal, boiled cabbage, the metallic tang of iron dust—but there was an undertow to it now, a loosened seam where the Lord Ruler's grip had been. People stepped into that seam and found things they hadn't expected: authority, hunger, fear.\n",

      "Elend's plan was awkward and noble. He would charm the master of the house, distract with questions about reform and the proper way to balance a taxed land, while I slipped below.

Tin made the world hum the way it had when I was a cutpurse: a map of breath and cloth and metal.\n",

They clung to each other like braided cords. I wanted to scoop them up and run until the city was a memory, but there was still work to be done.\n",
      "\n",

      "They did not scream when we came. They had been taught not to. I soothed them with brass—soft embers on a cold night—because sometimes the only prayer you can offer is to dull the worst of someone else's pain if you cannot remove it entirely. It felt like stealing their shrieks along with their chains, but better than letting them suffer.\n",

      "The alarm came the way it always does: stupid, human, and loud. A clumsy guard shoved through the doorway, eyes red with the wine of courage. He lunged. I let him lurch into a pewter-enhanced dodge and used iron to yank on a metal ring by his belt, pulling him forward so he slammed into the stair.

I also knew the world carved itself slowly, and not all ideals survived the whetstone.\n",
